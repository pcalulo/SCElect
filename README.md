An election management program. Written by me when I was still in high school.

...what?
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This program was written by me when I was in my 3rd/4th year of high school
for faster student council elections. At the time, tallying the votes of ~100
students took a good chunk of the day. I felt I could make something to shorten
that.

Can I use this program to run our school's student council elections?

You *could*, but that doesn't mean you *should* :)

I'm putting the code here as an easy reminder for everyone about why OOP and
good program design matters. Please don't actually use it in the real world.
